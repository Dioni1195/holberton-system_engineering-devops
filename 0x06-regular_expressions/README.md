## Holberton project to learn regular expressions
---
For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Here is the Ruby code that I use:

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```
